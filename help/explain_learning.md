## How to learn with this tool

### Step 1 Pick a language

You need to understand how a language staks up against the others before you start learning it. 
If your budy tells you to learn 'Monkey' than you might as well be one if you take that advice.
You can get a feel for what is actually being used and what is popular in the real world with this tool. 
Now you have a data based answer as to why you choose this language. 
Use it for your first or you 15th language. 

### Step 2 Find out where to learn from the best

There are a lot of ways to learn a language. Just starting to type is probably not the best way. 
You want to have good practices also. Learning how the best do it will really help you to write great code also.
Use the repo tool to find repositories written in the language you want to learn and see how its done. 
Also you can find really cool tools to leverage for your first apps. 
In this tool you can also see what tools and repos are becoming popular quick. 
A perfect example is 'data' in R, where Nate Silver is putting his analysis. Thats a gold mine that I found from this tool!

### Step 3 Find a mentor
Some programmers are just rock stars. They may not own the repo that has the most stars but they are contributing to it. 
Its always importatn to have someone to look up to and to learn from. With the contributors tool, you can find who is really the rock star with the language you are learning. Keep up with what he is making and doing and it will hopefully help you to learn quick and have some positive footstep to follow in your journey

I hope you learn great things and change the workd in wonderful ways!
